# AI_USAGE.md  
## Use of Artificial Intelligence in This Project

This document explains how AI tools (ChatGPT) were used during the development of this project, in accordance with responsible-use and academic transparency requirements.

---

## 1. Purpose of AI Use  
AI was used as a **support tool**, mainly for:
- clarifying programming and machine learning concepts,
- helping improve code readability and structure,
- assisting with debugging and error interpretation,
- formatting documentation (README.md, PROPOSAL.md, AI_USAGE.md).

The student remains fully responsible for:
- all coding decisions,
- pipeline design and implementation,
- dataset preparation,
- model training and evaluation,
- interpretation of results.

---

## 2. Tasks Where AI Provided Assistance  

### ✔️ Code Assistance  
- Suggested improvements to code structure and module organization.  
- Proposed clearer comments, docstrings, and naming conventions.  
- Provided examples of clean and maintainable Python patterns.  
*(All suggestions were reviewed and modified by the student.)*

### ✔️ Debugging & Explanations  
- Helped interpret Python errors and warnings.  
- Clarified concepts such as TimeSeriesSplit, feature engineering, model evaluation, and leakage prevention.

### ✔️ Documentation Help  
- Reformatted the project proposal into Markdown.  
- Assisted in drafting the README.md structure.  
- Helped write this AI_USAGE.md.

## 3. Tasks AI Did **Not** Perform  
AI was **not** used to:
- design the research question or methodology,  
- create the dataset or run the pipeline,  
- generate model outputs or influence results,  
- write large sections of code automatically,  
- interpret empirical results.

All analyses, modeling decisions, and interpretations were made by the student.

---

## 4. Responsible Use  
- AI outputs were manually reviewed and adapted.  
- No sensitive or proprietary data was shared.  
- AI served strictly as a *coding and documentation assistant*, comparable to consulting official documentation or StackOverflow.

---

## 5. Attribution  
ChatGPT (OpenAI) was used as a supportive tool for explanations, debugging help, and documentation formatting.  
**All implementation, experimentation, and conclusions are the student’s own work.**
